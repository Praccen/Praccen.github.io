			Hello!
		</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to my portfolio website!<br><br>
			My name is Gustav and I have a Master of Science in Engineering degree in Game and Software Engineering from Blekinge Tekniska Högskola (BTH), Sweden.
			I am passionate about game development and have a big interest in everything game engine related.

		<p>
			I've been a part of designing and developing the rendering framework used for the displays in SAAB's JAS 39 Gripen E/F fighter jets, and been a developer, team lead, and Engineering Manager for developing mobile forensic applications targeting Android devices.<br>
			On this website, you can see the projects I have worked on outside of working hours, such as game projects, school projects, and game jam submissions. Enjoy!<br>
