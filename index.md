Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Gustav and I am currently on the last semester of my master of science program in game and software engineering at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (BTH). I am passionate about game development and have an especially big interest in game physics.

# I program games and stuff. 
# - Here are some of my projects:

### S.P.L.A.S.H2O
Splash is a ray traced online first person shooter. The story is that a scientist has cloned himself in order to have someone to play games with. He then proceeds to turn off all the lights in his laboratory and give all his clones some candles and a water gun each. What happens next is a last man standing water fight where the goal is to eliminate other players by extinguishing their candles. The game can be played online with up to 12 players in the same game.

We were 12 students working together during the large game project at BTH. I created the physics including collisions, raycasting, bounding boxes, octree as well as the particle effects framework/back end and frustum culling.

### SPASM
SPASM is a 2,5D arena shooter made by me and 4 other students during the small game project at BTH and is the result of 8 weeks of development from scratch.

### K2A Web based game
Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with WebGL as a freelance project ordered by the PR-agency [Redgert Comms](http://redgertcomms.com/ "Redgert Comms homepage") as a way to market the stock exchange listing of the company [K2A](https://www.k2a.se "K2A homepage").

The game can be played [here!](./K2A "K2A Game")

### Scuffed Newton
Scuffed Newton is my physics engine. It is a continuation of the physics engine I made for SPLASH. The physics engine is compiled as a DLL for easy usage. This also allows me to explicitly link the DLL and be able to hot load it to see changes immediately. This can be observed in my Scuffed Newton test client. Scuffed Newton can of course also be implicitly linked.

### Master thesis on collision detection using neural networks
I am currently working on my master thesis together with my classmate [Alexander Wester](https://pirat.dev). We are experimenting with using Neural Networks to detect collisions in 3D environments and comparing it to Separating Axis Theorem.

### hEYEght mapper
A heightmap editor made with physically limited users in mind. Using eye-tracking we created a tool to edit heightmaps.
