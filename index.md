## S.P.L.A.S.H2O
Splash is a ray-traced online first-person shooter. The story is that a scientist has cloned himself in order to have someone to play games with. He then proceeds to turn off all the lights in his laboratory and give all his clones some candles and a water gun each. What happens next is a last man standing water fight where the goal is to eliminate other players by extinguishing their candles. The game can be played online with up to 12 players in the same game.

We were 12 students working together during the large game project at BTH. The game is made from scratch and I created the physics including collisions, raycasting, bounding boxes, octree as well as the particle effects framework/back end and frustum culling.

The repo is available [here!](https://github.com/BTH-StoraSpel-DXR/SPLASH "SPLASH repo")

## SPASM
SPASM is a 2,5D arena shooter made by me and 4 other students during the small game project at BTH and is the result of 8 weeks of development from scratch. I contributed with creating models, animations, map building, block appearance and connections, score visualizations, and some varius gameplay related features.

The repo is available [here!](https://github.com/Piratkopia13/DV1504_SPASM "SPASM repo")

SPASM has been showcased by BTH at multiple events such as Comic Con Stockholm where the game was very appreciated. So much so that we have been recommended by BTH representatives to release the game on a platform like Steam. Hopefully, we can get the time to do this soon.

## K2A web-based game
Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with WebGL as a freelance project ordered by the PR-agency [Redgert Comms](http://redgertcomms.com/ "Redgert Comms homepage") as a way to market the stock exchange listing of the company [K2A](https://www.k2a.se "K2A homepage").

## Scuffed Newton
Scuffed Newton is the start of my own physics engine. It is a continuation of the physics engine I made for SPLASH. Scuffed Newton is compiled as a DLL for easy usage and contains support functions to allow explicit linking. So far Scuffed Newton is mostly a component-based collision engine that uses Separating Axis Theorem to find collisions (including continuous collisions) and provides a very simple collision response. However, most of the detection part is there (like collision manifolds, etc) to start implementing everything needed for dynamic rigid-body collisions.

The repo is available [here!](https://github.com/Praccen/ScuffedNewton "Scuffed Newton repo")

## Master thesis on collision detection using neural networks
Check out my masters thesis which I conducted together with my classmate [Alexander Wester](https://pirat.dev). We experimented with using Neural Networks to detect collisions in 3D environments and comparing it to Separating Axis Theorem. We were able to achieve intersection testing 15.6 times as fast as when using Separating Axis Theorem.
