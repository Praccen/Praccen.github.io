        <h1>S.P.L.A.S.H2O</h1>
        <p>
            Splash is a ray-traced online first-person shooter. The story is that a scientist has cloned himself in order to have someone to play games with. He then proceeds to turn off all the lights in his laboratory and give all his clones some candles and a water gun each. What happens next is a last man standing water fight where the goal is to eliminate other players by extinguishing their candles. The game can be played online with up to 12 players in the same game.

            We were 12 students working together during the large game project at BTH. The game is made from scratch and I created the physics including collisions, raycasting, bounding boxes, octree as well as the particle effects framework/back end and frustum culling.

            The repo is available <a href="https://github.com/BTH-StoraSpel-DXR/SPLASH">here!</a>

        <h1>SPASM</h1>
        <p>
            SPASM is a 2,5D arena shooter made by me and 4 other students during the small game project at BTH and is the result of 8 weeks of development from scratch. I contributed with creating models, animations, map building, block appearance and connections, score visualizations, and some varius gameplay related features.

            The repo is available <a href="https://github.com/Piratkopia13/DV1504_SPASM">here!</a>

        <p>
            SPASM has been showcased by BTH at multiple events such as Comic Con Stockholm where the game was very appreciated. 
            So much so that we have been recommended by BTH representatives to release the game on a platform like Steam. 
            We would like to add online multiplayer support before releasing it, so let's see if it happens in the future.

	<h1>Ludum Dare 53 - News Flash!</h1>
        <p>
            Iterating on the previous WebGL engine by making it much more capable of proper 3D rendering, we got fully immersed into the 3D world, making a first person news paper delivery game. Really happy with how it turned out! The scope was big enough that we felt happy with the result, but simple enough to actually get it working properly in the 72 hours we had.

        <h1>Ludum Dare 51 - Decachronomorphia</h1>
        <p>
            For Ludum Dare 51, I expanded the typescript and WebGL engine I made for LD50 to include 3D rendering and some more advanced 3D physics. We made a dungeon crawler which looks kind of nice, but we overscoped a bit, and ran out of time before we managed to balance the game properly. Oh well.

        <h1>Ludum Dare 50 - Mr. Fuse</h1>
        <p>
            For Ludum Dare 50, I ported the simple 2D engine we used for LD49 to typescript and WebGL. We made a foddian escort platformer where you move up a tower while bouncing a bomb, it's hard, but fun!

        <h1>Ludum Dare 49 - Un-stabled</h1>
        <p>
            I participated in Ludum Dare 49! The theme was "Unstable" and we went the punny way by making a game about getting out of the stable as a horse. Doing a game jam was super fun and I definitely want to do more of them!

        <h1>K2A web-based game</h1>
        <p>
            Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with WebGL as a freelance project ordered by the PR-agency <a href=http://redgertcomms.com/>Redgert Comms</a> as a way to market the stock exchange listing of the company <a href=https://www.k2a.se>K2A</a>.<br>

            <img src="./K2A/Assets/Textures/Characters/Johan/Johan_K2A.png" style="width: 10%; image-rendering: pixelated;"> The game can be played <a href=./K2A>here!</a>

        <h1>Master thesis on collision detection using neural networks</h1>
        <p>
            Check out my masters thesis which I conducted together with my classmate <a href=https://pirat.dev>Alexander Wester</a>. 
            We experimented with using Neural Networks to detect collisions in 3D environments and comparing it to Separating Axis Theorem. 
            We were able to achieve intersection testing 15.6 times as fast as when using Separating Axis Theorem.<br>
